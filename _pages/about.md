Hi, and welcome to my corner of the internet! My name is Jordan Madden, and I am a student currently pursuing a Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Binghamton University. There, I am specializing in the fields of Machine Learning and Digital Signal Processing. I am deeply interested in leveraging data-driven approaches to solve complex problems, and I am passionate about exploring the intersections of these two exciting fields.

Prior to my graduate studies, I worked as a Wireless Engineer at Huawei Technologies, where I worked towards the optimization, deployment and expansion of the transmission aspect of the telecommunication network in Jamaica and the Caribbean.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering from the University of the West Indies, Mona.
My thesis investigated the use of Machine Learning for the prototyping of a navigation device for the blind/visually impaired.
