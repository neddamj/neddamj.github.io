Hello! Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I am a PhD student at Binghamton University under the supervision of Professor Xiaohua (Edward) Li. At a high level I am interested in robust and reliable machine learning. More specifically I am interested in studying the behavior of machine learning models and systems from an adversarial perspective in order to understand and mitigate security and privacy risks posed by these systems.

I am affiliated with the [Jamaica Artificial Intelligence Association](https://jaia.org.jm/), where I help to lead the research efforts.
