Hello! I'm Jordan Madden, a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Binghamton University, under the guidance of Professor Xiaohua Li. I earned my master's degree from Binghamton University in Spring 2024, and I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering from the University of the West Indies, Mona in 2021.

At a high level, I am interested in robust and secure machine learning. More specifically I am interested in studying the behavior of machine learning systems from an adversarial perspective in order to understand and mitigate security and privacy risks posed by these systems.

I am affiliated with the [Jamaica Artificial Intelligence Association](https://jaia.org.jm/), where I help to lead the research efforts.

Prior to my graduate studies I was a Wireless Network Engineer at Huawei Technologies, where I worked on the optimization and deployment of long range transmission systems for telecommunications networks.
